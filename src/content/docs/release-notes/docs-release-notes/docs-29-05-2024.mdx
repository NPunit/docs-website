* [A new feature of the iOS agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/configuration/ios-remote-logging/) to collect the stdout and stderr output of the apps it instruments is rolled out.

### Major change

* Updated the version support information (under prerequisites section) about the [service broker for TAS](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/other-infrastructure-integrations/cloudfoundry-integrations/vmware-tanzu-service-broker-integration/) (Tanzu Application Service) 6.0 

### Minor changes

* [Updated the support date](https://docs.newrelic.com/eol/2024/04/eol-04-24-24-polling-api/) for Azure SQL database. Azure is deprecating the SDK the polling API uses and will no longer be providing critical updates to this API, creating security concerns moving forward.
