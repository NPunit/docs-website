The data collection program `/NEWR/ABAP_COLLECTION_MANAGERN` is the main program that collects data and sends it to New Relic. To ensure efficient data collection, it's recommended to separate data providers into three groups and schedule them as separate jobs.

## Recommended data provider groups

### TRACE group

This group focuses on performance database (STAD) related data providers. It is designed to run efficiently with parallel processing in background RFC processes.
