    ## Create Lookup Table (SAP Cockpit Only)

      The SAP Cockpit dashboard uses a lookup table for a list of SAP systems and their environment. The table structure contains 2 columns: SYS_ID and Env. Arrange your SAP systems into groups that you'd like to view and save them into a CSV file.

      **Sample Lookup File:**

      ```plaintext
        SYS_ID Env
        GD1 DEV
        SD2 DEV
        AQ1 Testing
        AQ2 Testing
        SP1 Prod
        SP2 Prod
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>

**Steps to Create the Lookup Table on New Relic Platform:**

1. Select the menu Log -> Lookup Table.
2. Press the "Add a table" button, enter the table name "NR_LKUP_SYSTEM", and upload a CSV file containing the relationship between the environment and the systems.
3. Check the SAP Cockpit dashboard to see if the first page shows the correct system status.

### Install the Out-of-the-box Alerts Policies

1. Select the Alerts tab. One alert policy is available to install.
2. Click on the "New Relic Monitoring for SAP Solutions" alert policy. Select the account to install, and the alert policy will be installed.
3. Navigate to Alerts & AI -> Alert conditions (Policies) -> Nr4sap default alert policy. Turn on the switch on the right side for each alert condition you’d like to enable.

### Install IDOC Nerdlet

1. Select the “App & Visualizations” tab. One App, "IDOC Explorer," is available to install.
2. Select the "IDOC Explorer," click on “Manage access,” then select the account you’d like to access the app. The IDOC Explorer will be visible when viewing IDOC entities.

### Setup System Workload

1. Navigate to All entities -> Workloads, click on “+ Create a workload” on the top right corner.
2. Enter the name for the workload, enter the condition `sap.system = {SAP System SID}` on the filter bar, click the “+ Add this query” button to add the query to the workload definition.
3. Click the “Create workload” button to create the workload. The workload will be visible on the “All entities” UI and includes all the entities tagged with the SAP System.

### Upgrade from Previous Version

#### Install Upgrade Package

When upgrading from a previously installed version of New Relic Monitoring for SAP Solutions, pay attention to the packages used, as upgrade packages are often specific to the current version installed.

1. Use SAP transaction SAINT in client 000 to update the ABAP Add-on.
2. To find out the currently installed version, use the menu path System -> Status. Then click on the button. Look for the product “NEWR” for the version.

#### Backup the Configuration Template

If data provider configurations are changed or custom data providers are created, save them to the configuration template to prevent them from being overridden by the new version. Save any configuration changes BEFORE
