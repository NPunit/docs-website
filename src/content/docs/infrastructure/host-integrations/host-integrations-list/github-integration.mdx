<Callout title="preview">
    We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

    This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>


Implementing a New Relic Service Catalog can unlock considerable benefits, but it requires considerable time and resources. You have to take care of team orchestration, user provisioning, role assignments, and entity ownership delineation. These create a significant threshold for entry. To ease this challenge, consider an automation solution that capitalizes on existing team configurations and relationships maintained in external systems such as GitHub. This simplifies the initial configuration and accelerates the adoption of the New Relic Service Catalog.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Users need to ensure that they're logged in to their GitHub accounts. This needs to be the same GitHub account in which they want to install the GitHub app that New Relic will be providing during installation step.


## Set up the GitHub integration [#set-up-github]

Vist <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > + Integrations & Agents** > GitHub integration</DNT> tile and follow the below steps to complete the GitHub integration.

<Steps>
    <Step>

## Service Catalog Details [#service-catalog-details]

In this step, you have to enable or disable the Power Service catalog option. This option provides users the ability to import all data related to teams, repositories, pull requests, pull request reviews, and deployments.

Users can enable it for importing all the items mentioned in the Power Service Catalog. Disabling it, users will only be able to import basic information about the teams and repositories.
    </Step>

## GitHub Integration [#github-integration]

Next, click Install. The GitHub App installation page loads. New Relic provides this app to fetch the GitHub account information of a user.

Once the installation is complete, we will see the result page which will dynamically list down the retrieved GitHub data related to teams, repos, pull requests and deployments. It will take some time to fetch the complete inforamtion, hence the page will keep refreshing after every 10 seconds till we've the power service catalog ready. 

The result obtained will look like the below: 

| Category | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Teams | List of teams within the GitHub organization |
| Repositories | List of repositories owned by the GitHub account |
| Pull Requests | List of open and closed pull requests |
| Deployments | List of deployment events  |

These list items will be clickable links that will open up new tabs with more information like this below:
