Using a single CloudFormation template you can easily set up your AWS integration and forward New Relic AWS services [metrics](/install/aws-cloudwatch/), logs, or both.
1. Log in to your [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com/) account.
2. Navigate to [<DNT>**Integrations & Agents > AWS**</DNT>](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/marketplace/install-data-source)
3. Select a New Relic account and continue.
4. Select the telemetry type you want to send to your New Relic account.
5. Select <DNT>**Automate AWS with CloudFoundation**</DNT> and continue. This is currently the only setup method available for log integration.
