### Granting access to Vulnerability Management

Review the current custom roles created for your organizations. Add 'read' permissions for the 'vulnerabilities' capability to grant access to view Vulnerability Management. Standard roles are automatically be granted this capability but custom roles need to have 'read' permissions granted.

### Removing user access to Vulnerability Management

Users with the ability to create/adjust roles within their organization can modify who has access to Vulnerability Management. You can remove access to Vulnerability Management by creating a custom role that does not have 'read' permissions for the 'vulnerabilities' capability. You must then apply this custom role to the users that you wish to restrict.
