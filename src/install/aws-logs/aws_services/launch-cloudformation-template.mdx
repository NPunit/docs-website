1. Click <DNT>**Launch your CloudFormation in AWS**</DNT> to navigate to your AWS Console. The CloudFormation stack will include the configured parameters based on your selections in New Relic One, so no additional editing is necessary unless you choose to make changes.
2. Copy and paste your license key into your AWS console.

We recommend you store your New Relic license key in <DNT>**AWS Secrets Manager**</DNT> by keeping the environment variable set to `true` (default value).
