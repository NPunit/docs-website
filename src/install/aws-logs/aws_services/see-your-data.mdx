To complete the AWS account integration in New Relic, follow these steps:
1. Go back to the <DNT>**Connect your AWS Account**</DNT> page in the New Relic platform instance.
2. Provide the licence key:
   * If you are using an existing license key, paste it in <DNT>**License key**</DNT> and continue.
   * If you have created a new key, just select <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>. 
9. Select <DNT>**See your data**</DNT>.

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see log data in both of these places:

* Our [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data).
For example, you can run a query like this:

   S3 lambda / CloudWatch lambda:
   ```
   SELECT * FROM Log WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'aws' AND instrumentation.name = 'lambda'
   ```
   Cloudwatch firehose:
   ```
   SELECT * FROM Log WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'aws' AND instrumentation.name = 'firehose'
   ```

If no data appears after you enable the log management capabilities, or the custom attributes are not appearing in the log, refer to the following troubleshooing procedures:
* [Logs not appearing from CloudWatch via Firehose](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/logs-not-appearing-from-cloudwatch-firehose)
* [Logs not appearing from CloudWatch via Lambda](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/logs-not-appearing-from-cloudwatch-lambda)
* [Logs not appearing from S3 via Lambda](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/logs-not-appearing-from-s3-lambda)
* [Custom attributes not appearing in logs](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/custom-attributes-not-appearing)
* [Failing to delete a Stack](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/stack-deletion-fails)
* [Log forwarding restrictions](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/log-forwarding-restrictions)

### Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, follow standard procedures in [Amazon CloudWatch documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html). You do not need to do anything else in New Relic.
